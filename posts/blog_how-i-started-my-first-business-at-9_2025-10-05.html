        <p>At just nine years old, I launched Ellie World Creations, selling handmade goods and t-shirts, a journey that evolved into publishing a cookbook and eventually founding Honey Bunny Originals, a brand dedicated to inclusive baking.</p><p>When I was nine, most kids were dreaming about new toys or summer holidays. Me? I was dreaming of owning a bakery. The smell of fresh bread, the sight of perfectly iced cupcakes – it was my ultimate fantasy. There was just one tiny hurdle: I was nine, and getting a bakery license was, shall we say, a tad out of reach for a third grader. But that didn't stop my entrepreneurial spirit from bubbling up.</p><p>My incredible mom, seeing my passion and the slight roadblock with the bakery idea, had a brilliant suggestion. She enrolled me in a six-week entrepreneurship bootcamp. It was there that Ellie World Creations was born. We pivoted from flour and sugar to soap, bath bombs, and my personal favorite, punny baked-goods t-shirts. Two weeks after my ninth birthday, fueled by an overflowing imagination and a newfound business plan, I proudly debuted my brand at a local “Lemonade Stand Festival.” It was exhilarating, scary, and absolutely addictive.</p><p>As I moved through elementary school and into middle school, Ellie World Creations continued to grow and evolve. My family has several food allergies, including gluten and nuts, which always made finding safe, delicious treats a challenge. This personal experience inspired my next big project: I published *The Ellie World Cookbook and Creations*. It was a gluten- and nut-free cookbook, packed with recipes that allowed my family and others with dietary restrictions to enjoy baking and treats without worry. This cookbook wasn't just a passion project; it laid the crucial foundation for what would become my current venture, Honey Bunny Originals.</p><p>Fast forward to 2022, and Honey Bunny Originals officially launched. We offer gluten-free, nut-free, and vegan cookie mixes, designed to make safe, joyful family baking as easy as can be – just add eggs and butter. It's truly a full-circle moment, bringing my original bakery dream to life in a way that truly serves a community I care deeply about.</p><p>My journey from a nine-year-old with a lemonade stand to a young entrepreneur has been a whirlwind of learning. I've experienced everything from the thrill of vending at local fairs to the intricacies of running an SEO-optimized Etsy shop. I’ve learned to pivot with seasons and regulations, and even found creative ways to fund the business, like selling Canva templates from past school projects. Through all the changes and challenges, my goal has always remained the same: helping people create sweet, lasting memories, no matter their dietary needs. It started with a dream, a supportive mom, and a lot of imagination, and it continues to be the most rewarding adventure of my life.</p>
